# CoVis

For the development of therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19, scientists depend on reliable research results. To support them, [Open Knowledge Maps](https://openknowledgemaps.org) and [ReFigure](https://refigure.org) have launched CoVis: a curated knowledge map of seminal works on COVID-19 from eight critical areas of biomedical research. The knowledge map is constantly evolving thanks to the collective editing of subject-matter experts.

CoVis enables you to spend less time reviewing coronavirus literature and more time on your research.
