                <h4 class="question">What is a knowledge map?</h4>
                
                <p class="example">
                    <a href="./img/knowledgemap-covid-19.png" data-toggle="lightbox">
                        <img class="shadow2 abstand" src="./img/knowledgemap-covid-19.png" alt="Screenshot Knowledge Map on Covid-19 research">

                    <span>Screenshot: Knowledge Map on Covid-19 research</span>

                <p class="paragraph-style">
                    Knowledge maps provide an instant overview of a topic by showing the main areas at a glance, and resources related to each area. This makes it possible to easily identify useful, pertinent information.
                </p>
                
                <p class="paragraph-style">Areas are displayed as bubbles. By clicking on one of the bubbles, you can inspect the resources assigned to it. The size of the bubbles is relative to the number of resources assigned to it. Closeness of bubbles implies subject similarity. The closer two bubbles, the closer they are subject-wise. Centrality of bubbles implies subject similarity with the rest of the map, not importance. The closer a bubble is to the center, the closer it is subject-wise to all the other bubbles in the map.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-style">The knowledge map is based on the open source software <a href="https://github.com/OpenKnowledgeMaps/Headstart" target="_blank">Head Start</a> developed by Open Knowledge Maps.</p>
